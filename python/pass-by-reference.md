#### Is python pass-by-reference or pass-by-value? - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38895768/python-pandas-dataframe-is-it-pass-by-value-or-pass-by-reference)
As a short answer, Python always does pass-by-value, but every python variable is actually a
pointer(location) to some object, so sometimes it looks like pass-by-reference.
